##  Leveraging Pre-Trained Transformers for Legal Contract Analysis: From PDF to Risk Assessment


### Description:

In the realm of legal contract analysis, the integration of cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques has revolutionized the traditional methodologies. Harnessing the power of pre-trained models based on transformers, this innovative approach streamlines the process from document ingestion to comprehensive risk assessment, offering unprecedented efficiency and accuracy.

### Background

Build a legal contract analysis system that will analyze for one clause based on full previous legal contracts for the similiar clause, the reason is that this is a new area for the general LLM model, we will extract similiar clause from the full database of previous one, add some new information for the model.


### Steps Summary

1. Load new coming contract and get user provides question.
2. Split current contract based on paragraph for each clause.
3. Do pre-processing step like split, stop words remove, normalize to get the list of words
4. Load full historical contracts and do preprocessing step like new coming contract
5. Use embedding models to embed these list of words and save them into VectorDB.
6. Get similiar clause from VectorDB based on selected clause
7. Construct them into the clause prompt and sent it to LLM model
8. Wait for the LLM model to get the result and send result to user.
   


### Process step

The process commences with the ingestion of legal contracts in PDF format, leveraging specialized tools to seamlessly convert them into machine-readable text. This initial step ensures the accessibility of the document's content for subsequent analysis, eliminating the inherent limitations posed by the proprietary nature of PDF files.

Upon conversion to text, the pre-trained transformer model embarks on a meticulous extraction process, discerning and isolating relevant clauses from the corpus. Employing advanced linguistic features and contextual understanding, the model adeptly identifies key clauses, provisions, and contractual obligations embedded within the document, thereby laying the foundation for comprehensive analysis.

Subsequently, the extracted clauses are channeled into a new instance of a Language Model (LM), tailored specifically for risk assessment in legal contracts. This LM, primed with domain-specific knowledge and trained on vast repositories of legal texts, possesses the capability to discern nuanced legal nuances and implications inherent within contractual clauses.

Through a synergistic fusion of cutting-edge NLP techniques, the LM navigates through the extracted clauses, evaluating their implications within the context of pertinent legal frameworks and precedents. Leveraging probabilistic inference and semantic analysis, the model identifies potential risks, ambiguities, and contractual discrepancies, empowering legal practitioners with actionable insights to mitigate liabilities and safeguard their interests.

### Goodness

In essence, the integration of pre-trained transformers into the legal contract analysis paradigm represents a paradigm shift in the field, enabling expedited document processing, nuanced clause extraction, and sophisticated risk assessment. By amalgamating state-of-the-art technologies with domain-specific expertise, this transformative approach heralds a new era of efficiency and precision in legal contract analysis, fostering informed decision-making and risk mitigation strategies.
