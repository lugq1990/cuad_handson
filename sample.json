The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.  The Company agrees to exercise this right in                            good faith,  and  consider all  circumstances  of the                            Distributor  and the  Company.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event that the government or  controlling body of any country or territory in which Bundles are distributed imposes any law, restriction or regulation that makes it illegal  to distribute the Products, or any portion of them, into such country or territory, or if any such law, restriction or regulation places a  substantial burden on Google, where substantial is measured with respect to Google's economic benefit under this Agreement, as  determined by Google in its reasonable and good faith judgment (such substantial burden, a \"Substantial Burden\") then either party or  Google (in the case of a Substantial Burden) may require the suspension of all distributions of Bundles in such country or territory until  such time as such law, restriction or regulation is repealed, nullified or modified such that it is no longer illegal or a Substantial Burden (in  the case of Google), as applicable, for Bundles to be distributed in such country or territory (\"Special Suspension\"); provided, however,  that Distributor's obligations under Clause 3.5 (Exclusivity) shall not apply in respect of the relevant country or territory during any  period of Special Suspension. If a period of Special Suspension extends for more than [ * ] may then terminate this Agreement (in part) in  respect of the affected country or territory only, such termination to take effect upon written notice[ * ].

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement: (a) all rights and licenses granted under this Agreement shall  immediately cease; (b) Distributor shall (and shall ensure that any Third Party Distributors shall) immediately stop reproducing the  Products and offering or distributing Bundles; (c) Distributor shall return or destroy (and a duly appointed officer of Distributor shall  certify to such destruction) all copies of the Products and any other Google Confidential Information in its possession; and (d) the fees  payable to Distributor shall immediately cease accruing and Google shall within [ * ] following such expiration or termination pay to  Distributor any undisputed amounts which have accrued from the time of the most recent payment to Distributor through the date of  termination or expiration of this Agreement. Clauses 5.6 (Effect of Termination), 6 (Confidential Information), 7 (Proprietary Rights), 9  (Limitation of Liability), 10 (Indemnification) and 11 (General) shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n  - 8 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n6.

It does not include  information that the recipient already knew, that becomes public through no fault of the recipient, that was independently developed by  the recipient or that was lawfully given to the recipient by a third party.\n\n6.2 The recipient of any Confidential Information shall not disclose that Confidential Information, except to Group Companies, employees  and/or professional advisors who need to know it and who have agreed in writing (or in the case of professional advisors are otherwise  bound) to keep it confidential. The recipient shall ensure that those people and entities: (a) use such Confidential Information only to  exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this Agreement, and (b) keep such Confidential Information confidential. The recipient may  also disclose Confidential Information when required by law, or the regulation or rule of a major US stock exchange or the United States  Securities and Exchange Commission, after giving reasonable notice to the discloser, such notice to be sufficient to give the discloser: (i)  the opportunity to seek confidential treatment, a protective order or similar remedies or relief prior to disclosure (if applicable) and (ii)  (where any disclosure is necessary) time to consult on and approve the form and content of the relevant disclosure. The parties shall then  promptly discuss and agree in good faith on the form and content of the disclosure (each acting reasonably).\n\n7.

''Government officials\" include any  government employee, candidate for public office, and employee of government-owned or government-controlled companies, public  international organisations, and political parties. Furthermore, Distributor will not make any facilitation payments, which are payments to  induce officials to perform routine functions they are otherwise obligated to perform.\n\n8.6 No conditions, warranties or other terms apply to the Products, [ * ] or to any other goods or services supplied under this Agreement  unless expressly set out in this Agreement. Subject to Clause 9.1, no implied conditions, warranties or other terms apply (including any  implied terms as to satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose or conformance with description).\n\n9.

If the amount referred to in (b) above cannot be calculated accurately at the time the relevant liability is to be  assessed (the \"Applicable Time\"), it shall be calculated on a pro-rata basis as X/Y x Z. Where:     X = the total sum paid and payable to the Distributor pursuant to Clause 4 in the relevant Contract Year prior to the Applicable Time;     Y = the number of days elapsed in the relevant Contract Year prior to the Applicable Time; and     Z = 365     *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (c) breach of any implied condition as to title or quiet enjoyment; and\n\n  (d) misuse of confidential information.\n\n9.2 Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit either party's liability under Clause 10 (Indemnities), or Distributor's liability under Clause  2 (License Grants and Restrictions), Clause 3.5 (Exclusivity), Clause 3.6 (End User License Agreement) and Clause 3.7 (Accurate  Reproduction) or Clause [ * ].\n\n9.3 Subject to Clauses 9.1 and 9.2, neither party shall be liable under this Agreement (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) for any:\n\n  (a) loss of anticipated savings;\n\n  (b) loss of business opportunity (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not include loss of advertising revenue);\n\n  (c) loss of or corruption of data;\n\n  (d) loss or damage resulting from third party claims; or\n\n  (e) indirect or consequential losses;\n     suffered or incurred by the other party (whether or not such losses were within the contemplation of the parties at the date of this  Agreement).\n\n9.4 Subject to Clauses 9.1 and 9.2, each party's total liability under or in connection with this Agreement (whether in contract, tort or  otherwise) arising in any Contract Year is limited to the greater of:\n\n  (a) [ * ] Euros ([ * ] Euros); and\n\n  (b) [ * ]% of the total payment due to the Distributor in the relevant Contract Year pursuant to Clause 4 (Payment Terms).\n\n  - 11 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   By Distributor.\n\n   User claim arising out of or resulting from such End Users use of any Distributor App(s), including any actions or claims in product  liability, tort, contract or equity.     *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n10.

These practices include but are not limited to installing  software on computers without obtaining informed end user consent (the so-called \"drive-by download\"), inundating end users with  advertisements without adequate attribution or labeling, exposing users to pornographic material without obtaining informed end user consent,  obtaining or transmitting personal information about an end user without obtaining informed end user consent, and interfering with an end user's  ability to easily uninstall applications the end user does not wish to be on his or her computer.     Google does not wish to be associated with these types of practices. Accordingly, Google has developed the Guidelines set forth below to prevent  its trademark, other intellectual property, and services from being used in connection with these practices. Google believes that these Guidelines  are necessary to protect Google from any allegation that it has contributed to practices that might be viewed as unlawful or actionable; to preserve  the reputation of Google as a provider of trusted software and services in a manner that is beneficial and fair to users and other constituents; and  to stem the rising incidence of practices that harm users and diminish the perceived value and reliability of the internet, which are essential to  Google's business.     With this objective in mind, Google has established the following Guidelines to apply to customer Applications that are bundled with any Google  Application. Except to the extent Google has otherwise specifically agreed in writing, Google does not grant permission to, and you will not,  bundle any Application with a Google Application unless you ensure that any such Application specified in the agreement between you and  Google that incorporated these Guidelines complies with these Guidelines.     For the avoidance of doubt, by these Guidelines Google does not intend to, and does not, impose any restrictions on what you may do with any  Application that is not bundled with a Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google  services; you remain free to sell any Application you wish (whether or not it complies with these Guidelines) so long as it is not bundled with a  Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google services.     In these Guidelines: (a) \"you\" and \"your\" refer to the legal entity(ies) that has entered into the contract with Google into which these Guidelines  are incorporated, as well as any person or entity acting on your behalf; and (b) \"Application\" means any application, plug-in, helper, component or  other executable code that runs on a user's computer, examples of which include those that provide browser helper objects, instant messaging,  chat, email, data, file viewing, media playing, file sharing, games, internet navigation, search and other services.    Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  - 23 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   Google welcomes input about these Guidelines from you and from other interested parties, and is always willing to consider revisions as  appropriate to encourage innovation while protecting against deceptive, unfair and harmful practices. Accordingly, Google may update these  Guidelines, including the Attachments, from time to time as provided in Section 10 below.     If you have any questions about these Guidelines, please do not hesitate to discuss them with your Google account manager.     Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  - 24 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   1. General.     1.1 Approval and Ongoing Compliance. You may bundle Google Applications with Applications only to the extent permitted in the  signed written agreement into which these Guidelines have been incorporated. In such instance, you must ensure that your Application both (1)  has been approved by Google for the purpose of being bundled with Google Applications in writing in advance, and (2) complies at all times with  the requirements outlined herein. To obtain Google's approval for any Applications not expressly approved in your agreement, you must submit a  written request.     1.2 No Google Branding or Attribution. Your Application, and any related collateral material (including any Web pages promoting your  Application or from which your Application is made available), must not contain any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then  only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing. In addition, queries entered into Applications may not resolve to a results page  that contains any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing.     2. Prohibited Content. You may not bundle any Google Application with an Application that: (a) contains any viruses, worms, trojan horses, or the  like; and (b) is distributed primarily for the purpose of (i) distributing pornographic, obscene, excessively profane, gambling-related, deceptive,  fraudulent or illegal content, or (ii) distributing content related to \"hacking\" or \"cracking.\"     3. Prohibited Behavior. You may not bundle any Google Application with an Application that engages in deceptive, unfair, harassing or otherwise  annoying practices. For example, the Application may not:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (a) use, or permit an unaffiliated person to use, an end user's computer system for any purpose not understood and  affirmatively consented to by the end user (including, without limitation, for purposes of consuming bandwidth or  computer resources, sending email messages, launching denial of service attacks, accruing toll charges through a dialer  or obtaining personal information from an end user's computer such as login, password, account or other information  personal to the end user);\n\n  (b) intentionally create or exploit any security vulnerabilities in end user computers;\n\n  (c) trigger pop-ups, pop-unders, exit windows, or similar obstructive or intrusive functionality, that materially interfere with  an end user's Web navigation or browsing or the use of his or her computer;\n\n  (d) repeatedly ask an end user to take, or try to deceive an end user into taking, an action that the end user has previously  declined to take (such as repeatedly asking an end user to change his or her home page or some other setting or  configuration);\n\n  - 25 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4. Disclosure and Consent.     4.1 Disclosure and Consent before Installation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application unless you (and your  distribution and bundling partners, if applicable under the terms of the agreement between you and Google that incorporates these Guidelines)  design the installation of any such Application in a manner that ensures that it is installed by end users in a knowing and willful manner - e.g., no  \"drive-by' downloads or installs. By \"distribution partner\" we mean any third party who distributes your Application and by \"bundling partner\"  we mean any third party who installs your Application in combination with or alongside one or more other Applications. At a minimum, compliance  with this provision requires that, prior to installing your Application, you and any third party distributing or bundling your Application:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4.2 Disclosure and Consent for Collection and Transmission of Personally Identifiable information. You may not bundle any Google  Application with any Application that (1) collects or transmits to any entity other than the end user personally identifiable information, or (2)  collects or transmits information related to a user's computer or Internet usage or activity in a manner that could collect or transmit such user's  personally identifiable information (such as through keystroke logging), unless prior to the first occurrence of any such collection or transmission  you:\n\n   Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (e) redirect browser traffic away from valid DNS entries (except that your Application may direct unresolved URLs to an  alternative URL designated by you, provided that the page to which the end user resolves adequately informs the end  user that you and your Application are the source of that page);\n\n  (f) interfere with the browser default search functionality (except that your Application may permit an end user to change  his or her default search engine with proper disclosure, consent and attribution as provided below); or\n\n  (g) engage in activity that violates any applicable Jaw or regulation.\n\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose to end users:\n\n  (i) that they are installing an application,\n\n  (ii) the name of the Application, identifying you as the entity responsible for it, and\n\n  (iii) the principal and significant features and functionality of the Application; and\n\n  (b) then, obtain the end user's affirmative consent to install the Application.\n\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose:\n\n  - 26 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4.3 Disclosure and Consent for Setting Changes. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that makes a  change to any operating system or Application data setting which will impact the user experience of other Applications (e.g., changing the  browser default home page or changing the default application for a file type, such as the default email, browser or media player application),  unless prior to making such change you:\n\n\n\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no disclosure and consent need be made for changes to operating system or Application data settings that  have only a minor impact on user experience, such as adding a small number of bookmarks to the browser menu or adding an item to a start menu,  and (ii) the disclosure and consent requirements of this Section 4.3 will not apply to those setting changes that may be made prior to sale to the  end user.     4.4 Method of Disclosure and Consent. In order to satisfy the requirements above, the disclosure of the items specified above (a) must be  provided in both (1) the End User License Agreement (EULA) or privacy policy (to the extent required by law or otherwise by industry custom)  and (2) separately from the EULA and/or privacy policy (e.g. in installation screens or message boxes, as the case may be), and (b) must be  designed so that it will be read by, adequately inform and evidence the consent of a typical Internet user. See Attachment 1 for sample disclosure  and consent implementations that would satisfy certain of the requirements above.     4.5 EULA and Privacy Policy. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application unless it conforms, and is distributed  pursuant to a EULA that conforms, with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, you and your Application must comply with the  agreements and representations you make with your end users in your EULA and privacy policy. Your privacy policy must be accessible from  your Application in an easily found location. If your Application collects or transmits any other information related to the user's use of his or her  computer, but not required to be disclosed and consented to pursuant to Section 4.2, then the collection and use of such other information must  be disclosed in your privacy policy.     Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (i) the type of information collected (described with specificity in the case of personally identifiable information),\n\n  (ii) the method of collection (e.g. by registration, etc.), and\n\n  (iii) the location of (i.e., a link to) the privacy policy that governs the collection, use and disclosure of the  information; and\n\n  (b) then, obtain the end user's affirmative consent to such collection and/or transmission.\n\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose the change in a manner that will explain the practical effect of  such change; and\n\n  (b) then, obtain the end user's affirmative consent to make such change.\n\n  - 27 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   5. Transparency. Neither you nor any of your third party distribution or bundling partners may mislead end users or create end user confusion  with regard to the source or owner of an Application or any portion of its purpose, functionality or features. For example, all elements of your  Application that are visible to the end user must clearly identify their source through its branding and attribution, and that identification, whatever  form it takes, must correspond to the identification of your application in the menu that permits end users to remove programs. You must clearly  label advertisements provided by your Application (if any) as such and clearly identify your Application as the source of those advertisements. In  addition, if your Application modifies the operation or display of other applications or Web sites (other than Web sites that you own), then in  each instance you must clearly and conspicuously attribute the source of that modification to your Application (as distinct from the application or  Web site modified) in a manner that will inform a typical Internet user; provided that this requirement will not apply to modifications for which you  obtain disclosure and consent pursuant to Section 4.3. See Attachment 1 for examples of modifications that are clearly and conspicuously  disclosed to end users.     6. Deactivation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that impairs an end user's ability to change any preferences or  settings set by the Application in accordance with the way that such preferences or settings ordinarily may be changed by the applicable  Application. Once disabled by an end user, your Application may not be re-enabled without an affirmative action by the end user to explicitly re- enable your application. Accordingly, no use, update, installation or re-enablement of a separate Application, and no code downloaded as a result  of browsing a Web site, may operate to re-enable your Application. Your Application must permit end users to uninstall it (in the customary place  the applicable operating system has designated for adding or removing programs, e.g., Add/Remove Programs control panel in Windows) in a  straightforward manner, without undue effort or skill. In addition, your Application, when running, must provide (in an easily found location) clear  and concise instructions on how it may be uninstalled. Once uninstalled, your Application must not leave behind any functionality or design  elements, and all setting changes made by the application, but not explicitly agreed to by the end user, should be reversed to the extent  practicable.     7. Bundling of Applications. In addition to the requirements set forth in the agreement between you and Google that incorporates these  Guidelines, in order for you to bundle any Application with a Google Application must satisfy each of the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\n\n   Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (a) the end user is made aware of all of the Applications included in the bundle prior to any installation;\n\n  (b) all such Applications included in the bundle or download comply with the provisions of Section 2 through 6 of these  Guidelines;\n\n  (c) if Applications in a bundle in which you are participating are supported in part by revenue generated by advertising  displayed in another independent Application included in that bundle and the continued use of the Application is  conditioned on such other independent Application remaining installed and active on the end user's computer, the end  user must be made aware of that relationship; and\n\n  - 28 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   8. Information and Assistance. Subject to any confidentiality obligations owed to third parties, you must provide Google with such information as  Google may reasonably request about the distribution of those of your Applications that are bundled with any Google Application. For example,  we may ask you to share with us: (a) the means by and/or the locations from which your Applications are distributed; or (b) the identity of any  applications included in any of your bundling relationships (and the entities responsible for such applications). In addition, you must provide  such assistance as Google may reasonably request to investigate and stop potential violations of these Guidelines that may be connected to your  Application, including by way of using such number of identifiers and other tracking parameters as Google may reasonably request. This would  include providing Google with \"golden masters\" of any bundle or other distribution that includes your Application, or working with Google to  stop any entities that may be financially benefiting from your Application from engaging in any of these proscribed practices. You understand,  however, that Google has no obligation to provide support to end users of your Application. For the avoidance of doubt, these information and  assistance rights do not extend to any of your Applications that are not used to access Google services, bundled with a Google Application, or  bundled with an Application that accesses Google services.     9. Legal. You must maintain ownership and control of your Application at all times to the extent required to practically and legally enforce the  requirements of these guidelines. If you are seeking to permit a third party Application to be bundled with a Google Application, then you must  also obtain Google's written approval of that third party Application (in addition to the approval required for your Application). If Google  approves the third party Application, you are responsible for ensuring that such third party Application also complies with these Guidelines.  Special indemnity and other suspension and/or termination provisions may apply. These are addressed in your agreement with Google.     10. Updates.     10.1 General. As mentioned above, Google may update these Guidelines, including the Attachments, from time to time; provided,  however, that no updates will be effective until Google provides you with thirty (30) days' written notice thereof. Once you receive that notice (the  date on which you receive such notice, the \"Update Notice Date\"), you will be required to bring your Application into compliance within thirty (30)  days     Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (d) either (1) the bundle must provide for a master uninstaller that will enable the end user to uninstall every Application in  the bundle without undue effort or skill, or (2) if no master uninstaller is provided, the de-installation of any Application  may not be dependent or conditioned upon the de-installation of any other Application included in the bundle.\n\n  - 29 -\n\n\n\n\n\n  10.2 Extended Compliance Period. If, solely as a result of an updated requirement, one or more of your Applications no longer complies  with these Guidelines, as updated, and you are incapable of bringing such Application into compliance prior to the scheduled effective date of  such update (the \"Update Effective Date\"), you agree to provide Google with written notice thereof as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any  event no later than the Update Effective Date, identifying the Application and the reasons why it may not be brought into compliance prior to the  Update Effective Date, and providing such other detail as Google may reasonably request with respect thereto (consistent in any event with your  confidentiality obligations). Thereafter, the parties will consult, and you agree to will work, diligently and in good faith to develop and execute a  plan to bring such Application into compliance with these Guidelines, as updated, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within  ninety (90) days of the Update Notice Date (the \"Maximum Compliance Period\"). You agree that you will provide Google with such information as  Google reasonably requests during this period to keep Google apprised of your progress in bringing your Application into compliance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to the next sentence), in no event may a new requirement provided for in any update to these  Guidelines require you to take any action which would violate the terms of any agreement between you and any unaffiliated third party that is in  effect on the date that Google delivers notice of the proposed update. In any event, if you are unable to bring any Application into compliance  during the Maximum Compliance Period, Google may elect, by providing at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, to require you to cease  bundling either the specific non-conforming Application or those versions of the Application which are, or are distributed, in violation of the  Guidelines, as updated; it being understood that, at such time, you will be entitled to procure services from an alternative source for those  Applications (or versions thereof) with respect to which Google has exercised such election.

If the parties agree that the Target Professional included on such list has (or should have) a primary specialty designation of or otherwise currently practices in the specialty of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then Dova will submit an inquiry to Dova's Third Party Data Source for each such Target Professional, requesting that Dova's Third Party Data Source conduct an investigation to determine the primary specialty designation of each such Target Professional. In addition, if the Parties do not agree, but Valeant, acting reasonably and in good faith, still believes that the Target Professional has (or should have) a primary specialty designation of or otherwise currently practices in the specialty of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then Dova will submit an inquiry to Dova's Third Party Data Source for each such Target Professional, requesting that Dova's Third Party Data Source conduct an investigation to determine the primary specialty designation of each such Target Professional. The Parties shall equally share in the incremental costs to Dova of any such investigations by Dova's Third Party Data Source.

In the event that, following such investigation, Dova's Third Party Data source does not change the primary specialty designation to Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology or, in the case of those Target Professionals with a primary specialty designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and a secondary specialty designation of Hepatology, changes the primary specialty designation to a specialty other than Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then those Target Professionals shall be deemed not to be in the Specialty. For those Target Professionals that were not the subject of an inquiry to or an investigation by Dova's Third Party Data Source, then the specialty designations set out in the original list generated by Dova's Third Party Data Source shall apply for such Calendar Quarter, namely those Target Professionals that have either a\n\nSource: DOVA PHARMACEUTICALS INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nprimary or a secondary specialty designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and that do not have either a primary or a secondary specialty designation of Hepatology shall be deemed to be in the Specialty.\n\n6.5.4 The process described in this Section 6.5 shall be repeated for each Calendar Quarter of the Term; provided, however, that, pursuant to the process described above, if Dova's Third Party Data Source has confirmed that a Target Professional's primary specialty designation should be or should remain Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, it is not necessary for Valeant to seek this confirmation in subsequent Calendar Quarters; provided, further, that, if Dova's Third Party Data Source is subsequently updated (by Dova or any Third Party) to change the specialty designation (primary or secondary) of a Target Professional, pursuant to a request by Dova or a Third Party, then the process described in this Section 6.5 shall be repeated with respect to such Target Professional.\n\nARTICLE 7  AUDIT RIGHTS\n\n7.1 Recordkeeping.

The Party seeking indemnification under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable (the \"Indemnified Party\") shall give prompt notice to the Party against whom indemnity is sought (the \"Indemnifying Party\") of the assertion or commencement of any Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable, and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to give such notice will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual prejudice thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the defense and settlement of any such action, suit or proceeding at its own expense. The Indemnified Party shall, if requested by the Indemnifying Party, cooperate in all reasonable respects in such defense, at the Indemnifying Party's expense. The Indemnified Party will be entitled at its own expense to participate in such defense and to employ separate counsel for such purpose. For so long as the Indemnifying Party is diligently defending any proceeding pursuant to this Section 11.3, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable, for any settlement effected without its consent. No Party shall enter into any compromise or settlement which commits the other Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action without the other Party's prior written consent (and unless such compromise or settlement includes no payments by the Indemnified Party, an unconditional release of, and no admission of liability by, the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Claim).\n\n11.4 Limitation of Liability.

THE FOREGOING SENTENCE SHALL NOT LIMIT (1) THE OBLIGATIONS OF EITHER PARTY TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY FROM AND AGAINST THIRD PARTY CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 11.1 OR 11.2, AS APPLICABLE, OR (2) DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTY'S BREACH OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-USE OBLIGATIONS IN ARTICLE 9.\n\n11.5 Insurance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that during the Term, it shall maintain, through purchase or self- insurance, adequate insurance, including products liability coverage and comprehensive general liability insurance, adequate to cover its obligations under this Agreement and which are consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly situated. Each Party shall provide reasonable written proof of the existence of such insurance to the other Party upon request. Dova does not and will not maintain or procure any worker's compensation, healthcare, or other insurance for or on behalf of any Field Force Personnel, all of which shall be Valeant's sole responsibility. For clarity, the insurance requirements of this Section 11.5 shall not be construed to create a limit of either Party's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE 11.\n\nARTICLE 12  TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n12.1 Term.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") approved DOPTELET on May 21, 2018 for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. DOPTELET represents the first thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist approved in the United States for this indication.\n\nThrombocytopenia, a condition in which patients have a low platelet count, is the most common hematological abnormality in patients with CLD that often worsens with the severity of liver disease. It is estimated that approximately 15 percent of the 7.5 million patients with CLD have some form of thrombocytopenia. In a study published in 2010, patients with severe thrombocytopenia (<75,000/\u00b5L) had a 31 percent incidence of procedure-related bleeding. As a result of the associated increased rate of bleeding, there is an increased risk for the CLD patient when undergoing common scheduled medical procedures such as liver biopsy, colonoscopy, endoscopy, and routine dental procedures.\n\nAs part of the co-promotion arrangement, Salix intends to deploy approximately 100 sales specialists who will promote DOPTELET to gastroenterology healthcare professionals. The Salix sales force will begin selling DOPTELET in mid-October 2018. Dova will continue its commercial efforts targeting primarily hepatologists and interventional radiologists and certain other specialties. Pursuant to the agreement, Dova will pay Salix a quarterly fee based on net sales (as defined in the agreement) of DOPTELET prescribed by gastroenterologists in the U.S.\n\n\"We are delighted to be working with Salix, a company considered by many to have the preeminent gastroenterology sales force in the United States,\" said Alex C. Sapir, president and chief executive officer, Dova Pharmaceuticals. \"Given Salix's presence and strong reputation within large gastroenterology group practices coupled with the early interest we are seeing among the gastroenterology community, we are excited to see the impact this partnership will bring to DOPTELET and to patients.\"\n\n\"Salix considers liver disease a strategic therapeutic area of focus, given our history and knowledge with XIFAXAN\u00ae (rifaximin), an innovative medicine indicated for the treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a condition that is often a consequence of chronic liver disease,\" said Mark McKenna, president, Salix Pharmaceuticals. \"Adding DOPTELET to our portfolio will enable our sales force to promote yet another innovative product that addresses a true unmet need in the marketplace.\"\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

DOPTELET is designed to mimic the effects of TPO, the primary regulator of normal platelet production.\n\nTwo global Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (ADAPT-1 [N=231] and ADAPT-2 [N=204]), conducted in adults with thrombocytopenia (platelet count of less than 50,000/\u00b5L) and CLD, supported the FDA approval. Patients were assigned to either 40 mg or 60 mg of avatrombopag daily for five days based on their Baseline platelet counts (40 to <50,000/\u00b5mL or <40,000/\u00b5mL, respectively). Avatrombopag was shown to be superior to placebo in increasing the proportion of patients not requiring platelet transfusions or rescue procedures for bleeding up to seven days following a scheduled procedure in both trials in both the 40 mg (ADAPT-1, 88% vs. 38%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 88% vs. 33%; p<0.0001), and 60 mg (ADAPT-1, 66% vs. 23%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 69% vs. 35%; p=0.0006) treatment groups. Avatrombopag was also superior to placebo at the two secondary efficacy endpoints in each trial. In the avatrombopag treatment groups, there was an increased proportion of patients achieving the target platelet count of \u226550,000/\u00b5mL on procedure day, and a greater magnitude of the change in mean platelet count from baseline to procedure day; all treatment differences between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups for each secondary endpoint were highly statistically significant with p values <0.0001. The most common adverse reactions with avatrombopag included pyrexia, abdominal pain, nausea, headache, fatigue and edema peripheral. Portal vein thromboses have been reported in patients with CLD and in patients receiving TPO receptor agonists. One treatment-emergent event of portal vein thrombosis was reported in the ADAPT trials in an avatrombopag-treated patient.\n\nINDICATION\n\nDOPTELET (avatrombopag) is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nDOPTELET is a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist and TPO receptor agonists have been associated with thrombotic and thromboembolic complications in patients with chronic liver disease. Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease treated with TPO receptor agonists. In the ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2 clinical trials, there was one treatment- emergent event of portal vein thrombosis in a patient (n=1/430) with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia treated with DOPTELET.\n\nConsider the potential increased thrombotic risk when administering DOPTELET to patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism, including genetic prothrombotic conditions (Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin 20210A, Antithrombin deficiency or Protein C or S deficiency).\n\nDOPTELET should not be administered to patients with chronic liver disease in an attempt to normalize platelet counts.\n\nCONTRAINDICATIONS: None\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

It has been proven to reduce the risk of overt HE recurrence and HE-related hospitalizations in adults.\n\n*There is an increased systemic exposure in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when administering XIFAXAN to these patients.\n\nINDICATION  XIFAXAN (rifaximin) 550 mg tablets are indicated for the reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) recurrence in adults and for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) in adults.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\u2022XIFAXAN is not for everyone. Do not take XIFAXAN if you have a known hypersensitivity to rifaximin, any of the rifamycin antimicrobial agents, or any of the components in XIFAXAN.\n\n\u2022If you take antibiotics, like XIFAXAN, there is a chance you could experience diarrhea caused by an overgrowth of bacteria (C. difficile). This can cause symptoms ranging in severity from mild diarrhea to life-threatening colitis. Contact your healthcare provider if your diarrhea does not improve or worsens.\n\n\u2022Talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN if you have severe hepatic (liver) impairment, as this may cause increased effects of the medicine.\n\n\u2022Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking drugs called P-glycoprotein and/or OATPs inhibitors (such as cyclosporine) because using these drugs with XIFAXAN may lead to an increase in the amount of XIFAXAN absorbed by your body.\n\n\u2022In clinical studies, the most common side effects of XIFAXAN were: HE: Peripheral edema (swelling, usually in the ankles or lower limbs), nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), dizziness, fatigue (feeling tired), and ascites (a buildup of fluid in the abdomen)  IBS-D: Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and an increase in liver enzymes\n\n\u2022XIFAXAN may affect warfarin activity when taken together. Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking warfarin because the dose of warfarin may need to be adjusted to maintain proper blood-thinning effect.\n\n\u2022If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nursing, talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN because XIFAXAN may cause harm to an unborn baby or nursing infant. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800- FDA-1088.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

Immediately upon notification from PPI, such post termination  sales shall cease.   17.4 Other Remedies of EKR. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event that EKR is entitled to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 16.1(a), in addition to the right to terminate as provided therein and any other remedies EKR  may have hereunder, PPI shall assist EKR in the transfer of the manufacture of the Products, including the Specifications from PPI to EKR  or EKR's designee. In such event, the Royalty payments payable hereunder shall continue to be paid; provided,  however, that all costs  incurred by EKR in the transfer of manufacturing information from PPI and obtaining FDA approval of the manufacture of the Products by  EKR or EKR's designee, and any other amounts due to EKR, shall be deducted from any royalties payable to PPI. In addition, PPI shall  during the remainder of the Term and for a period of up to [**] ([**]) years thereafter continue to manufacture and supply the Product to  EKR at cost without mark-up until such time that EKR can secure an FDA approved manufacturing facility for the Product. PPI shall provide such advice as necessary for EKR to arrange for an alternative manufacturer and shall provide EKR with access to all relevant PPI  Know-How, and any other information necessary for EKR to transfer such manufacturing to an alternate manufacturer. In addition, (i) PPI  shall transfer to EKR any Marketing Authorizations held by PPI and (ii) the Trademark license granted under Section 2.3 shall continue in  effect following such termination on a perpetual basis and EKR shall be responsible for all costs associated with the maintenance of such  Trademark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -58-\n\n17.5 EKR Step-In Rights.\n\n\n\n(a) During the Term, in the event EKR has the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 16.1(a) - (i) hereof (the \"Step-in  Right Trigger Event\"), and EKR does not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement under such Section, EKR shall  have the option to exercise step-in rights to manufacture the Product for the remainder of the Term (the \"Step-in Right\") by  providing PPI written notice of such election within ninety (90) days after the Step-in Right Trigger Event (or such longer  period as mutually agreed by the Parties) (the \"Step-in Right Notice\"); provided that in the event such Step-in Right  Trigger Event has been cured prior to EKR's exercise of the Step-in Right, the Step-in Right shall terminate with respect to  such Step-in Right Trigger Event. The Step-in Right Notice shall specify the date which EKR intends to exercise the rights  associated with the Step-in Right.\n\n  (b) In the event EKR exercises the Step-in Right, PPI shall, at EKR's cost and expense, cooperate in the exercise of such rights  and EKR shall reimburse PPI for the reasonable costs PPI incurs in assisting EKR in the exercise of such rights within thirty  (30) days of EKR's receipt of invoice.\n\n\n\n(c) The Step-in Right shall include, without limitation, and to the extent allowable under Applicable Law, PPI's grant to EKR of  such additional license rights, rights of access, rights of observation and rights of management, direction and control, in  each case solely with respect to the manufacture and supply of Product and as reasonably necessary to enable and permit  EKR (or EKR's designee) to ensure that the supply of Product shall continue to be available to EKR under this Agreement  and the Supply Agreement; provided that EKR in exercising the Step-in Right shall not (i) unreasonably interfere with PPI's  other activities at the facilities at which the Product is manufactured, tested, labeled, stored or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -59-\n\n\n\notherwise handled (\"Product Facilities\") or (ii) require PPI to take any action or fail to take any action that does or could  reasonably be expected to interfere with PPI's other activities at the Product Facilities. The foregoing rights shall apply  with respect to any Product Facility to the extent necessary for EKR to preserve and protect supply of the Product as  contemplated by this Agreement and the Supply Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) upon termination of the Lease  Term, PPI shall maintain responsibility and control over all other products manufactured by PPI and nothing in this Section  17.5 shall give EKR any rights to direct, manage or control the manufacture of such products (ii) PPI shall maintain  responsibility and control over the facilities where Product is manufactured, tested, labeled, stored or otherwise handled  and nothing in this Section 17.5 shall give EKR general oversight or control of the facilities where Product is manufactured,  tested, labeled, stored or otherwise handled.\n\n  (d) In the event EKR exercises the Step-in Right, EKR shall comply with all policies applicable to the facilities where Product is  manufactured, tested, labeled, stored or otherwise handled and all Applicable Laws with respect to the manufacture of the  Product.\n\n18. Force Majeure   18.1 Obligation to Perform. Except for payment obligations which shall not be excused or affected by any Force Majeure, neither Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement or shall be liable to the other under this Agreement for loss or damages attributable to any Force  Majeure, provided the Party affected shall give prompt notice thereof to the other Party. Subject to Section 18.2, the Party giving such  notice shall be excused from such of its obligations hereunder for so long as it continues to be affected by Force Majeure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -60-\n\n18.2 Duration. If such Force Majeure continues unabated for a period of at least ninety (90) days, the Parties will meet to discuss in good faith  what actions to take or what modifications should be made to this Agreement as a consequence of such Force Majeure in order to alleviate  its consequences on the affected Party. If the affected Party is prevented by reason of any circumstances referred to in this Section of this  Agreement from performing any of its obligations hereunder for a continuous period of six (6) months the other Party may terminate this  Agreement.\n\n19.

Subject to Section 20.2, neither Party shall, nor shall it purport to, assign, license, transfer or change any of its rights or  obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld  conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 20.4 either Party may assign its rights hereunder to an  Affiliate or to any successor by merger, consolidation, sale of stock or other equity interests or the sale of substantially all of the assets of  such Party without the consent of the other Party. For the avoidance of doubt, either Party may grant a security interest with respect to its  rights under this Agreement in connection with a secured financing or similar transaction.   20.2 Sub-Distribution. EKR may appoint sub-distributors under this Agreement provided that EKR:\n\n  (a) informs PPI of the identity of any Third Party sub-distributor (other than Affiliate companies) prior to the execution of any  sub-distribution agreement;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -62-\n\n  (b) obtain a confidential nondisclosure agreement with the prospective Sub-Distributor in a form acceptable to PPI, which  acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and containing terms at least as stringent as those terms  included in Article 11 of this Agreement;\n\n  (c) deliver to the prospective Sub-Distributor a redacted copy of this Agreement (\"Redacted Agreement\") .  Any sub- distribution agreement shall provide that such agreement is subject and subordinate to the rights of PPI under this  Agreement; and\n\n  (d) provides PPI with a copy of written sub-distribution agreement as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution  thereof by EKR.   20.3 Responsibility of EKR. Notwithstanding any such sub-distribution agreement, EKR shall remain primarily liable to PPI for its obligations hereunder, and for any act or omission of any sub-distributor.   20.4 Change of Control. Should there be a Change of Control of either Party resulting in the control of such Party by a Third Party which  markets or sells a Competing Product in any part of the Territory, then the rights under this Agreement may not be assigned without the  express consent of the other Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. \"Change of Control\" shall mean (a) the sale, lease,  exchange, license or disposition of all or substantially all of the Party's assets in one transaction or series of related transactions or (b) a  merger or consolidation with an unaffiliated Third Party as a result of which the holders of the Party's issued and outstanding voting  securities immediately before such transaction own or control less than a majority of the voting securities of the continuing or surviving  entity immediately after such transaction. The issuance by either Party of securities in connection with any financing transaction or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -63-\n\n\n\npublic offering shall not be deemed a Change of Control under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purposes of Section  6.3(b)(iii): (i) references to a \"Party\" in the above definition of Change of Control shall be deemed to include PPI as well as any Affiliate of  PPI and (ii) a Change of Control shall also include (in addition to any of the transactions described above in the definition of Change of  Control), any sale of securities of PPI or its Affiliates directly by the holder (the \"Holder\") of such securities (other than to an Affiliate of  such Holder) in which such sale results in a transfer of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of PPI or its Affiliates.\n\n21.

Unless expressly agreed, no waiver of any term, provision or condition of this Agreement shall constitute a general waiver of any provisions of this Agreement, nor shall it affect any rights, obligations or liabilities under or pursuant to this Agreement which have  already accrued up to the date of variation, and the rights and obligations of the Parties under or pursuant to this Agreement shall remain in  full force and effect, except and only to the extent that they are so waived.   21.8 Unenforceability. If and to the extent that any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, void or unenforceable, such provision shall  be given no effect and shall be deemed not to be included in this Agreement but without invalidating any of the remaining provisions of  this Agreement.   21.9 Delay. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right or remedy provided by law under or pursuant to this Agreement shall  impair such right or remedy or operate or be construed as a waiver or variation of it or preclude its exercise at any subsequent time and no  single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise of it or the exercise of any other right or  remedy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(signature page follows)      -65-\n\n21.10 Cumulative Rights.
